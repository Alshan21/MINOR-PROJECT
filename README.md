# MINOR-PROJECT
Maintaining proper posture during physical exercises is essential for maximizing benefits and preventing injuries. Among common strength exercises, squats are particularly prone to form-related issues that can lead to long-term joint or muscle problems. This project presents a computer vision-based system that evaluates squat posture using video analysis. Unlike traditional posture feedback systems that rely on real-time webcam input, our system allows users to upload a video of themselves performing squats. The uploaded video is then processed to assess the correctness of posture throughout the movement.
The system uses the MediaPipe Pose framework to extract skeletal keypoints from each frame of the video. These keypoints, representing the user's body landmarks, are analyzed using a custom logic or classification model trained specifically to identify correct and incorrect squat positions. Based on this analysis, an output video is generated in which posture feedback is visually highlighted â€” green for correct squats and red for incorrect ones.
This offline and asynchronous approach offers users the convenience of reviewing their squat technique at any time, without requiring live monitoring or internet connectivity. It is particularly useful for fitness enthusiasts, physiotherapists, and trainers aiming to ensure safe and effective workouts. While the current system is focused solely on squats, it lays a scalable foundation for expanding to other exercises in future iterations. This project effectively demonstrates how computer vision can assist in promoting proper exercise habits through accessible and automated posture assessment.
